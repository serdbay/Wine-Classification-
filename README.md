## General Information
Wine experts can identify wines from specific vineyards through smell and taste, but the factors that give different wines their individual charateristics are actually based on their chemical composition.

In this challenge, we must train a classification model to analyze the chemical and visual features of wine samples and classify them based on their cultivar (grape variety).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
Before starting off this project you need to be familiar with machine learning especially with classification algorithm. Plus, you need to download our "wine.csv" file provided in the project. 

Our dataset can be downloaded from the UCI dataset repository (Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science).

## Usage
If you are doing a project on wine categorization, this project may be useful for you.

And also you can use this project, especially if you want to see projections for future of the company sales with sales-based wine categorization.
